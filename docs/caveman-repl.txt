Caveman REPL                                                    *caveman-repl*

REPL plugin built with caveman technology.

Usage                                                     *caveman-repl-usage*

Use |:CavemanReplStart| to start a REPL session.

Use |:CavemanReplSend| to send text to REPL's stdin.

REPL sessions are simply |:terminal| sessions.

                                                           *:CavemanReplStart*

>
    :CavemanReplStart [cmd args...]
<

Starts a REPL session. The command run is selected in the following order:

1. Command argument (see below)
2. Buffer variable |b:caveman_repl_command| (or vim.b.caveman_repl_command in
   lua)
3. User shell command (same as |:terminal|)

Arguments:

`cmd` is the command of the REPL program, and `args` are arguments to the
program.

Tip:

To configure a REPL cmd for a specific filetype, create a file
`ftplugin/<language>.lua` and paste in this script:

>
    -- example for python
    vim.b.caveman_repl_command = {'python3', '-qi'}
<

                                                            *:CavemanReplSend*

>
    :[range]CavemanReplSend [flags]
<

Sends selected text to the REPL session. Sends the current line if no range is
given.

Flags:

- `-trim=<behavior>`: see |b:caveman_repl_trim|

Configuration                                     *caveman-repl-configuration*

Configuration is done via the `g:caveman_repl_*` and `b:caveman_repl_*`
variables. In lua, you would use `vim.g.caveman_repl_*` and
`vim.b.caveman_repl_*` instead.

                                                      *b:caveman_repl_command*

Can be string or list of strings. The command (and arguments) to run for the
REPL session.

                                   *b:caveman_repl_trim* *g:caveman_repl_trim*

One of: 'none', 'always', 'follow_first_line'.

Used when sending input to the REPL session. Decides if indentation on each
line should be trimmed.

- `none`: Never trim indentation.
- `always`: Always trim all indentation.
- `follow_first_line`: Trim all indentation on the first line, and then trim
  the same level of indentation as the first line on subsequent lines.
